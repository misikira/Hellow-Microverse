To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.
Install
A customizable linting tool that helps you improve your site's accessibility, speed, cross-browser compatibility,
and more by checking your code for best practices and common errors.
NOTE: If you are running on Windows, you need to initialize npm to create package.json file.
-npm init -y
-Run
-npm install --save-dev hint@7.x
-not sure how to use npm? Read this.
-Copy .hintrc to the root directory of your project.
-Do not make any changes in config files - they represent style guidelines that you share with your team - which is a group of all Microverse students.
-If you think that change is necessary - open a Pull Request in this repository and let your code reviewer know about it.
Run
npx hint .
Fix validation errors.
Stylelint
A mighty, modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in your styles.
Run
-npm install --save-dev stylelint@13.x stylelint-scss@3.x stylelint-config-standard@21.x stylelint-csstree-validator@1.x
-not sure how to use npm? Read this.
-Copy .stylelintrc.json to the root directory of your project.
-Do not make any changes in config files - they represent style guidelines that you share with your team - which is a group of all Microverse students.

-If you think that change is necessary - open a Pull Request in this repository and let your code reviewer know about it.
-Run npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}" on the root of your directory of your project.

Fix linter errors.

-IMPORTANT NOTE: feel free to research auto-correct options for Stylelint if you get a flood of errors but keep in mind that correcting style errors manually will help you to make a habit of writing a clean code!
